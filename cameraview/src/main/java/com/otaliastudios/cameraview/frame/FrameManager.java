/**
 * This class manages the allocation of byte buffers and {@link Frame} objects.
 * We are interested in recycling both of them, especially byte[] buffers which can create a lot
 * of overhead.
 *
 * The FrameManager keeps a {@link #mPoolSize} integer that defines the number of instances to keep.
 * The pool size applies to both the {@link Frame} pool and the byte[] pool - it makes sense to use
 * the same number since they are consumed at the same time.
 *
 * Main methods are:
 * - {@link #setUp(int, Size)}: to set up with size and allocate buffers
 * - {@link #release()}: to release. After release, a manager can be setUp again.
 * - {@link #getFrame(byte[], long, int, Size, int)}: gets a new {@link Frame}.
 *
 * For both byte buffers and frames to get back to the FrameManager pool, all you have to do
 * is call {@link Frame#release()} when done.
 *
 * Other than this, the FrameManager can work in two modes, depending on whether a {@link BufferCallback}
 * is passed to the constructor. The modes changes the buffer behavior.
 *
 * 1. {@link #BUFFER_MODE_DISPATCH}: in this mode, as soon as we have a buffer, it is dispatched to
 *    the {@link BufferCallback}. The callback should then fill the buffer, and finally call
 *    {@link #getFrame(byte[], long, int, Size, int)} to receive a frame.
 *    This is used for Camera1.
 *
 * 2. {@link #BUFFER_MODE_ENQUEUE}: in this mode, the manager internally keeps a queue of byte buffers,
 *    instead of handing them to the callback. The users can ask for buffers through {@link #getBuffer()}.
 *    This buffer can be filled with data and used to get a frame {@link #getFrame(byte[], long, int, Size, int)},
 *    or, in case it was not filled, returned to the queue using {@link #onBufferUnused(byte[])}.
 *    This is used for Camera2.
